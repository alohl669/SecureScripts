secureScripts is a small set of tools for linux, designed to monitor
some basic system functions and locate possible vulnerabilities.
This set of tools is based on pentesting techniques for learning reasons

.SS showCommands
.PP
showCommands is a tool to discover the processes that go in and out of
execution.
This is useful for identifying vulnerabilities and/or malicious
applications.
One of its most useful examples is for discovering CRON processes.
The tool has the ability to use exclusion and inclusion filters and the
ability to add and remove them easily.
If a more detailed edition is desired, the txt files that are created
can be modified.

The application is based on an infinite loop and as a consequence brings
with it an excessive consumption of CPU, we will have to look for
alternatives
